title: AI for Earth Sciences
---
---
This workshop aims to highlight work being done at the intersection of AI and the Earth and Space Sciences, with a special focus on model interpretability at the ICLR 2022 iteration of the workshop (formerly held at ICLR 2020 and NeurIPS 2020). 

We showcase cutting-edge applications of machine learning to Earth and space science problems, including study of the atmosphere, biosphere (ecology), hydrosphere (water), lithosphere (solid Earth), sensors and sampling, and planetaryspace science. We also cultivate areas where Earth and planetary science is informing and inspiring new developments in AI, including theoretical developments in interpretable AI models, hybrid models with knowledge-guided AI, augmenting physics-based models with AI, representation learning from graphs and manifolds in spatiotemporal models, and dimensionality reduction. New Earth and planetary science datasets and visualizations that will enable faster integration of AI into the Earth and space sciences are also of particular interest.
