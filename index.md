title: AI for Earth and Space Science
---
---
This workshop aims to highlight work being done at the intersection of AI and the Earth and Space Sciences, with a special focus on model interpretability at the ICLR 2022 iteration of the workshop. 

We showcase cutting-edge applications of machine learning to Earth and space science problems from diverse fields, including, but not limited to: atmospheric science, ecology and evolutionary biology, effects of environmental change on human health, geoscience, human-earth interaction, hydrology, sensors and sampling, and planetary science. 

We also cultivate areas where Earth and planetary science is informing and inspiring new developments in AI, including theoretical developments in interpretable AI models, hybrid models with knowledge-guided AI, augmenting physics-based models with AI, representation learning from graphs and manifolds in spatiotemporal models, and dimensionality reduction. New Earth and planetary science datasets and visualizations that will enable faster integration of AI into the Earth and space sciences are also of particular interest. The workshop will highlight the following contributions in special sessions: 

* Planetary and Space Science  
* Solid Earth   
* Hydrosphere  
* Atmosphere  
* Ecology     
* Sensing and Sampling  

Please see the [ICLR website](https://iclr.cc/) for details on registering for this and other workshops at ICLR.  The ICLR registration fee is 50 USD for students and 100 USD for non-students.   

## Important dates

**AI4Earth Workshop at ICLR2022**    
Submission deadline: February 26, 2022 at 12:00 AM UTC (anywhere on earth) via [CMT](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/AI4Earth2022/)   
Author notifications: March 26, 2022  
Meeting: April 29, 2022  

**ICLR2022**    
Registration opens: February 2, 2022 at 2:00 PM UTC via [ICLR website](https://iclr.cc/)     
Meeting: April 25 - 29, 2022     

## Tentative Schedule

The full day workshop will feature a keynote presentation (large-attendance talk format), a panel discussion (small group talk format), and a poster session + social event. The event will be split into the following sessions (small group talk format): AI for atmosphere, ecology, water, solid Earth, sensors & sampling, and space science. Each session will feature an invited speaker and contributed talks from workshop participants, a Q&A session, and a gather.town breakout room for informal discussion and networking following the session. 

The panel discussion will focus on model interpretability and its importance to applications of AI to Earth and Space Sciences (e.g.: the design and implementation of successful environmental policy and entrepreneurship in AI for Earth Sciences). A full schedule will be posted on our website prior to the event.


## Submission instructions

We are accepting two forms of submissions: papers and posters. All submissions are due via [CMT](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/AI4Earth2022/) by Feb 26 '22 12:00 AM UTC (anywhere on earth). 
 
**Paper submissions:** To format your paper for submission please use the [main conference LaTeX style files](https://github.com/ICLR/Master-Template/raw/master/archive/iclr2022.zip). The workshop has a strict maximum page limit of 5 pages for the main text and 3 pages for the supplemental text. Citations may use additional, unlimited pages.

**Poster submissions:** Please submit an abstract for consideration. 

Please note that ICLR policy states:
"Workshops are not a venue for work that has been previously published in other conferences on machine learning. Work that is presented at the main ICLR conference should not appear in a workshop."

To see examples of successful past submissions see [NeurIPS2020](https://ai4earthscience.github.io/neurips-2020-workshop/) and [ICLR2020](https://ai4earthscience.github.io/iclr-2020-workshop/).
