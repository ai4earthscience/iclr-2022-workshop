## Tentative Schedule

The full day workshop will feature a keynote presentation (large-attendance talk format), a panel discussion (small group talk format), and a poster session + social event. The event will be split into the following sessions (small group talk format): AI for atmosphere, ecology, water, solid Earth, sensors & sampling, and space science. Each session will feature an invited speaker and contributed talks from workshop participants, a Q&A session, and a gather.town breakout room for informal discussion and networking following the session. 

The panel discussion will focus on model interpretability and its importance to applications of AI to Earth and Space Sciences (e.g.: the design and implementation of successful environmental policy and entrepreneurship in AI for Earth Sciences). A full schedule will be posted on our website prior to the event.
